# Library-Query-System
The purpose of this case study is design and implement a relational database and apply the  fundamental concepts of database management into the real-life scenario. For this project, we  will focus on library system which is a really common scenario in the real life, and everybody  must deal with this system at least once in his or her life. We hope through conceptual data  modeling, mapping the conceptual model, implementation of relation model and some data  visualizations to let the readers have a better understanding towards the rental book system  which includes what kinds of databases should be stored within the system and how each  database connects together.
